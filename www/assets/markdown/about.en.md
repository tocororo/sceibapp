## About

This tool has been developed within the framework of the international collaboration project [VLIR JOINT 2019-01-27 (SCEIBA)](https://www.vliruos.be/en/projects/project/22?pid=4202) and the sectoral project of the Ministry of Higher Education [MES] (https://www.mes.gob.cu/) entitled "Quality control and monitoring of scientific publications at the national and institutional level". Its objective is aimed at increasing the visibility of the scientific publications of the Cuban and Peruvian higher education systems, as well as the implementation of services that allow the monitoring and evaluation of their quality.

The results of these evaluations are expected to be useful for the development of strategies for the continuous improvement of the quality of scientific publications at the national or institutional level. To start the evaluation you must click on the “Start” button. At the end you will obtain general assessments and by state criteria, as well as a set of recommendations.
